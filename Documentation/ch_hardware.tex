\chapter{Hardware description}\label{ch:hardware}
The Ethoscope is comprised of the following parts:
\begin{description}
  \item[Top unit] This contains the main components of the Ethoscope, such as the processing unit, the camera and the environmental shield (optional). The components are enclosed in a plastic shell.
  \item[Base unit] The unit acts as a base for the whole Ethoscope and as a support and alignment tool for the arena. The base unit also contains the strip of \gls{led} used to provide \gls{ir} illumination to the arena.
  \item[Arena] The arena defines the experiment to be performed. The basic arena, provided with the standard kit, provides support for up to twenty glass tubes, each one defined as a \gls{roi}. Three black dots in the corner of the arena are used by the software to determine a spatial system of reference.
  \item[Side walls] The walls connect the base to the top unit and ensure a correct distance between camera and arena. The standard walls are made of 3~mm acrylic sheet.
