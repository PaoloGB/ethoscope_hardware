\chapter{Software description}\label{ch:software}

\section{Network Setup}\label{ch:network}
Each ethoscope unit comes pre-configured to join the WiFi network of the supplied router. Wired
access is also possible with an ethernet cable from the ethoscope to the router. The interface
for each device is available at the address printed on the case, which can be accessed in any web
browser on Windows, Mac OS X or iOS devices.

\section{Advanced use}\label{ch:advanced}
\subsection{MySQL access}\label{ch:mysql}
The recorded data can be retrieved from each ethoscope by accessing the MySQL database running on
the device. There are many open source and proprietry tools that can access MySQL databases. Read
only access is available with the username ``ethoscope'' and password ``ethoscope'' on the normal MySQL
port (3306).

\subsection{SSH access}\label{ch:mysql}
It is possible to logon to each ethoscope directly to perform custom configuration, however this is
discouraged because careless use can render the devices inoperable. In some cases this can invalidate
your warranty. For normal use it should never be necessary to access the device directly.

Advanced users who know what they're doing can access the device on the normal SSH port (22) with
the username ``pi'' and the password printed on the case of the ethoscope.

\subsection{Using a different network}\label{ch:mysql}
Ethoscope units will work on another network with no configuration if connected by an ethernet cable.
WiFi configuration is not possible with the current release of the software but will come in a
future update. It is however possible to SSH on to the device and configure other WiFi networks by
hand using the ``wpa\textunderscore{}cli'' Linux tool, but this is for advanced users only.

Please note that using Ethoscopes on open networks is discouraged since there is no encryption or
security in the current software release. Anybody on the same network can read all data and
start/stop runs. Rymapt is working to remedy this, and encrypted connections with access control
will be available in a future update along with guided WiFi setup.
